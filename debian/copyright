 Beverly, MA (May 14, 1999) - Leading entertainment software publisher, Hasbro
 Interactive announced today it has released all rights that it may have to the
 vintage Atari hardware platform, the Jaguar.
 .
 Hasbro Interactive acquired rights to many Atari properties, including the
 legendary Centipede, Missile Command, and Pong games, in a March 1998
 acquisition from JTS Corporation.
 .
 This announcement will allow software developers to create and publish software
 for the Jaguar system without having to obtain a licensing agreement with
 Hasbro Interactive for such platform development. Hasbro Interactive cautioned,
 however, that the developers should not use the Atari trademark or logo in
 connection with their games or present the games as authorized or approved by
 Hasbro Interactive.
 .
 "Hasbro Interactive is strictly focused on developing and publishing
 entertainment software for the PC and the next generation game consoles,"
 said Richard Cleveland, Head of Marketing for Hasbro Interactive's Atari
 Business Unit. "We realize there is a passionate audience of diehard Atari
 fans who want to keep the Jaguar system alive, and we don't want to prevent
 them from doing that. We will not interfere with the efforts of software
 developers to create software for the Jaguar system."
 .
